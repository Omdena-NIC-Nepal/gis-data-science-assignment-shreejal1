# Climate Data Analysis - Documentation

## 1. Introduction
Climate data analysis is essential for understanding trends in temperature, precipitation, and other meteorological factors. This study focuses on analyzing climate data from Nepal, aiming to extract insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and meaningful visualizations.

## 2. Data Overview
The dataset includes historical climate records, with attributes such as:
- **Temperature (Â°C)**: Daily recorded temperatures.
- **Precipitation (mm)**: Amount of rainfall or snow.
- **Geographical Data**: Latitude, longitude, and elevation.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### 3.1 Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Verified data types and converted where necessary.

### 3.2 Summary Statistics
- Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- Distribution analysis of temperature and precipitation.

### 3.3 Correlation Analysis
- **Findings:** Temperature and precipitation showed a negative correlation of **-0.44**, indicating that higher temperatures are associated with lower precipitation levels.

## 4. Key Visualizations & Interpretation
### 4.1 Temperature vs. Precipitation
- A scatter plot with a regression line demonstrated the inverse relationship.
- A color gradient was applied to enhance data readability (blue for lower temperatures, red for higher).

### 4.2 Geospatial Analysis
- Mapped precipitation across Nepal, showing regional variations.

## 5. Outcome Analysis
### Key Findings
- **Temperature Trends:** The data indicates a gradual increase in temperature over the years, suggesting a potential impact of climate change. The rise in temperature may have long-term effects on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity in Nepal.
- **Precipitation Distribution:** The data confirms that precipitation is highly seasonal, with significant peaks during the monsoon period (June-September). The variability in precipitation suggests potential risks of droughts in drier months and flooding during peak rainfall seasons.
- **Geographical Impact:** Higher altitudes consistently exhibited lower temperatures, whereas precipitation patterns varied significantly by region. The Himalayas experienced less precipitation in certain areas, while lower altitudes had a greater concentration of rainfall.
- **Negative Correlation Between Temperature and Precipitation:** The inverse relationship suggests that an increase in temperature is often accompanied by a decrease in precipitation, which may have implications for water availability and agriculture.
- **Extreme Weather Patterns:** The analysis indicates an increasing frequency of extreme temperature and precipitation events, which could contribute to natural disasters such as landslides and floods.
- **Implications for Policy and Planning:** These findings highlight the importance of climate adaptation strategies, improved water management, and disaster preparedness in Nepal to mitigate potential environmental and socio-economic impacts.
